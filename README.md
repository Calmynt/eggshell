# Eggshell
A tiny shell made for personal purposes.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MasterTextman/eggshell.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MasterTextman/eggshell)

After building the shell with `make`, you can run either one of two commands:
 - `./eggshell`
 - `./eggshell test`

The first one will run the **eggshell** normally, whereas the second one will
run some tests of the eggshell. The tests are run using the `testinput.txt` file.
Each line represents a seperate command that **eggshell** will try to execute.
