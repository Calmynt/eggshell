# All scripts for the eggshell have commenting support
# In order to indicate a comment, one should start a line with '#'
# Newlines are also ignored, so leave as many as you like.
# There is one rule that all scripts should abide by however.
# And that is that all scripts should end with a newline. Otherwise bugs'll appear.
